# Code Review for Game Systems

The codebase effectively implements all requested features following SOLID principles and game programming patterns. Here's a breakdown of the key systems:

## DecorationSystem
- Implements building/decoration system with grid-based placement
- Follows Single Responsibility Principle, handling only decoration placement
- Prevents decoration during focus time
- Implements snap-to-grid functionality
- Supports rotation and cancellation

## Timer
- Clean implementation of timer functionality
- Supports start, pause, and stop operations
- Provides time formatting and updates
- Uses Observer pattern for timer events
- Follows Single Responsibility Principle

## IsometricCamera
- Handles isometric camera setup
- Adjusts for different screen resolutions
- Clean separation of camera-specific logic

## StoryManager
- Implements story progression system
- Uses event-driven architecture
- Supports enable/disable functionality
- Tracks focus time for story progression
- Saves/loads progress

## InteractableObject
- Handles object interactions
- Prevents interaction during focus time
- Uses Observer pattern for interaction events
- Flexible system for multiple interaction types

## CurrencyManager
- Manages in-game currency
- Scales rewards based on focus time
- Handles currency transactions
- Saves/loads currency state

The code follows these key design patterns and principles:
1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has a clear, single purpose
2. **Observer Pattern**: Used for events and updates
3. **Dependency Injection**: Through Unity's component system
4. **Open/Closed Principle**: Systems are extensible without modification
5. **Interface Segregation**: Clean separation of concerns
6. **Command Pattern**: For handling user inputs
7. **State Pattern**: For managing game states (e.g., placement mode)

All requested features are implemented and working together cohesively. The code is well-structured and maintainable.
