# Unity C# Code Error Fixes

The following errors were identified and fixed in the codebase:

## 1. RoomManager.cs Fixes
- Added null checks for main camera and materials in Start()
- Added validation for grid size and cell size in InitializeGrid()
- Added null checks and error handling in StartPlacingFurniture()
- Improved error prevention in furniture placement workflow

## 2. StudyCharacter.cs Fixes
- Added null check for Animator component with proper error handling
- Added validation for dialogue events configuration
- Improved coroutine management for dialogue sequences
- Added checks for empty/null dialogue lines
- Added proper cleanup of running coroutines

## 3. GameManager.cs Fixes
- Added error handling for state transitions
- Added logging for state changes
- Added try-catch block to handle exceptions during state change events
- Added ability to rollback to previous state if error occurs

## What Went Wrong
1. **Null Reference Exceptions**: The code was not properly checking for null references before accessing components and objects
2. **Missing Validation**: Grid sizes, materials, and other parameters were not validated before use
3. **Coroutine Safety**: Dialogue coroutines were not properly managed, potentially causing conflicts
4. **Error Handling**: The code lacked proper error handling and logging
5. **State Management**: Game state changes were not properly protected against errors

## How the Fixes Help
1. Prevents crashes from null references
2. Provides clear error messages for debugging
3. Maintains better state consistency
4. Improves code robustness
5. Makes debugging easier with proper logging
6. Prevents invalid operations

The code should now be more stable and provide better error feedback when issues occur.
